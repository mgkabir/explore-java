The recommended way to run a JMH benchmark is to use Maven to setup a standalone project that depends on the jar files of your application. 
This approach is preferred to ensure that the benchmarks are correctly initialized and produce reliable results. It is possible to run 
benchmarks from within an existing project, and even from within an IDE, however setup is more complex and the results are less reliable.

In all cases, the key to using JMH is enabling the annotation- or bytecode-processors to generate the synthetic benchmark code. 
Maven archetypes are the primary mechanism used to enable this. We strongly recommend new users make use of the archetype to 
setup the correct environment. 
The methods in this class all throw a NullPointerException, if the specified array reference is null, except where noted. The documentation for the methods 
contained in this class includes briefs description of the implementations. Such descriptions should be regarded as implementation notes, rather than parts 
of the specification. Implementors should feel free to substitute other algorithms, so long as the specification itself is adhered to.
