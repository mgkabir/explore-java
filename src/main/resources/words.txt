The recommended way to run a JMH benchmark is to use Maven to setup a standalone project that depends on the jar files of your application. 
This approach is preferred to ensure that the benchmarks are correctly initialized and produce reliable results. It is possible to run 
benchmarks from within an existing project, and even from within an IDE, however setup is more complex and the results are less reliable.

In all cases, the key to using JMH is enabling the annotation- or bytecode-processors to generate the synthetic benchmark code. 
Maven archetypes are the primary mechanism used to enable this. We strongly recommend new users make use of the archetype to 
setup the correct environment.
